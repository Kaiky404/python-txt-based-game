**Village & “Thing” Concept — Summary**

* **Artifact:** Alien “thing” discovered by the first generation.
* **Generation 1 (Discoverers):** Eat the thing; unaffected themselves.
* **Generation 2 (Inheritors):** Children of Gen 1 inherit **psychopathy + enhanced abilities** (strength, intelligence, reflexes). Do not eat the thing themselves. All are dangerous.
* **Generation 3 (Main Character):** Child of Gen 2. Inherits DNA/epigenetic effects, but variable: may inherit powers, psychopathy, both, or neither. Our MC is partially/unaffected, making them unique.
* **NPCs:** Other Gen 3 children can inherit fully or partially, creating allies or antagonists.
* **Mechanics:** Effect is genetic/epigenetic; only Gen 1 consumes the thing.
* **Setting:** Village near a famous crossroads — constant traveler traffic, giving tension and story hooks.
* **Story Hooks:** Moral conflict, family vs outsider danger, MC’s uniqueness, potential exploration of the alien “thing.”
